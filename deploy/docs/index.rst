Welcome to ITKPythonPackage's documentation!
============================================

This project provides a ``setup.py`` script to build ITK Python wheels and
infrastructure to build ITK external module Python wheels.

`ITK <https://www.itk.org/>`_ is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.

To install the stable ITK Python package::

  $ pip install itk

For more information on ITK's Python wrapping, see `an introduction in the
Book 1, Chapter 3 of the ITK Software Guide <https://itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf>`_.
There are also many `downloadable examples documented in Sphinx
<https://itk.org/ITKExamples/search.html?q=Python>`_.
