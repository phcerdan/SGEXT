/**
 * Associate to each node of the graph a generation based on the branching of
 * the tree. Generation = 0 is associated to the root node. An end node of the
 * first branching will have generation 1.
 *
 * Sometimes is not clear in a Y branching if both ends will get its generation
 * increased, or only one. The parameter
 * decrease_radius_ratio_to_increase_generation allows to fine tune this
 * behaviour. Those nodes that have a smaller radius would increase its
 * generation.
 *
 * @sa tree_generation_visitor
 *
 * @param graph input spatial graph
 *
 * @param distance_map_image input distance map image @ref create_distance_map
 *
 * @param spatial_nodes_position_are_in_physical_space true if the positions
 * are in physical space.
 *
 * @param decrease_radius_ratio_to_increase_generation controls when the
 *  generation of a node will be increased, based on the radius decrease.
 *
 * @param keep_generation_if_angle_less_than Do not increase generation for
 *  angles smaller than this (in degrees). Used in the first pass using radius.
 *
 * @param increase_generation_if_angle_greater_than Increase generation if
 *  the angle is greater than this value. Angle analysis is used in a second
 * pass analysis, and it only applies to the cases where the first pass (based
 * on radius) generates at leat two branches with the same generation. It fails
 * to increase the target branch generation, when one of the sibling branches
 *  (with same source) got its generation increased by the radius first pass.
 *
 * @param num_of_edge_points_to_compute_angle
 *  When computing angles between edges with same source,
 *  use the edge point number m_num_of_edge_points_to_compute_angle closer to
 *  source.  Warning: This is not an index, but a count.
 *  If = 0, it uses the angle between source and target nodes (no edge points
 * involved)
 *
 * @param input_roots
 *  Vector holding user specified root nodes. If empty, the algorithm takes
 *  as root the vertex with greatest radius (from the distance map), and
 *  runs only in the largest connected component of the graph.
 *  If multiple roots are provided, the algorithm will start visiting from them.
 *  Also, it will assume there are disconnected components in the graph, one for
 *  each root.
 *
 * @param input_fixed_generation_map
 *  Map provided by the user to fix the generation for certain nodes.
 *  The algorithm won't modify the generation on those vertex.
 *  Empty by default.
 *
 * @param verbose extra infro to std::cout
 *
 * @return A map vertex to generation
